# Numbers-To-RomansNumbers-Convertor

A Software that converts Numbers to Roman symbols. I believe learning how to develop numbers to Romans symbols convertor is a good introducton to JS capabilities. I chose to develop this project to familiarize myself with DOM manipulation and useful JS methods such as toString() ,padStart() and split() as well as utilizing arrays to construct a dynamic relationship between values.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the user interface
- Create an API rather than using arrays of values for sustainability and scalability
- Add an option to convert Roman symbols to English script
